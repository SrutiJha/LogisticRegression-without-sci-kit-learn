# Logistic Regression - Handcrafted Implementation

This repository contains a complete from-scratch implementation of **Logistic Regression** using **batch gradient descent** for binary classification. The project demonstrates model training, evaluation, and visualization on a custom dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The goal of this project is to:

- Implement logistic regression without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
- Visualize the **cost function vs iteration** to observe model convergence.
- Plot the dataset with a decision boundary to analyze classification performance.
- Compare the effect of different learning rates.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
